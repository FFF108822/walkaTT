# üõç\ Walka: Smart Cultural Journey Planner

**Walka** is an AI-powered cultural tourism assistant designed to help users plan meaningful, personalized travel experiences. By integrating Google's Gemini API with a structured itinerary format, Walka turns natural language input into organized, actionable travel plans in seconds.

## ‚ú® Features

- üß† **AI-Powered Planning**: Enter a simple request like "Hangzhou one-day tour", and Gemini will generate a complete travel itinerary.
- üóìÔ∏è **Structured Output**: Plans are returned in a strict JSON format, including time, location, category, and description.
- üîÅ **Interactive Editing**: Users can modify generated plans through follow-up prompts (coming soon).
- üé® **Culturally-Themed UI**: The interface promotes Indigenous Australian and Yizu traditions, aligned with our mission.

## üì¶ Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js (App Router), React, Ant Design
- **AI Integration**: [Google Generative AI (Gemini)](https://ai.google.dev/)
- **Language**: TypeScript javascript
- **Styling**: CSS with theme-based customization

## üöÄ How It Works

1. On the homepage, the user enters a travel query.
2. After clicking **Generate Plan**, the app routes to `/generate`.
3. The backend calls Gemini with a strict prompt and receives a valid JSON plan.
4. The left panel displays the structured plan; the right panel will support interactive edits.
